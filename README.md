# The Titanium UX Library

## Disclaimer

This project is under active development and its actual status is in alpha or “preview” phase. Some parts can drastically change in short term. 

Use under your own risk. Bug reports, pull requests and any kind of collaboration are welcome.

## Description

The Titanium UX project arises to solve some common UX patterns that we use in our apps every day with Titanium Alloy.

The added value of this project is that each template and component is the result of a collaboration between an UX expert and a Titanium developer, 
and improved with cool designs done by pro apps designers.

The result is a collection of Templates with all the sources (mock up files for Omni-Graffle, designs in Illustrator and code in Titanium Alloy).

Regarding the code, the project now includes 3 templates with more than 20 reusable and customizable widgets of all kinds.

We are doing a big effort in creating useful widgets, with performance in mind and specially high integration with Alloy, so they can be added
to your xml files and 100% customizables from style files.

## Multiplatform Support

The project has been developed for and fully works on iPhone. Although the UX has been designed with iPhone users in mind, most components also work on android
and our intention is to give full support to the templates and widgets working in both platforms.


## Templates

### Franky: a detail view full of small widgets

Franky is our little monster. After review hundred of detail views in mobile apps, Sonia found the kind of components more usable and used
and put them all in a unique view, as a sample of what a detail view commonly includes.

This pattern will help you understand not only how to structure a kind of window like this, but also to have quick access to
a library of ready-to-use components that you can reuse.

It uses several custom widgets ready to reuse and support for [FontAwesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)

### Settings form: a template for modifying and input data

All we know what a settings form is, how often we use and develop them for apps and how long it takes to get fully working, 
including data validation, option pickers and so on.

This template will boost the process of creating new forms and will do it super easy to edit and maintain.

### Sign up form: a step-by-step form template

It is becoming more than usual that some input data processes, as for example sign up, buying process and so on, are made in a step-by-step way, 
so the user is more comfortable and not swamped by a large quantity of data to fill in.

This example adds all the needed logic to create the step-by-step navigation and also adds an high level of customization for your process. 

By now, only text fields are supported, with several validation methods, support for custom validation methods, synchronous and asynchronous validation and
invalid data detection.

## Component Widgets

### com.criteriastudio.RemoteImageView

the scroll event by the parent container (tipically a table view or a scrollview)

### ti.ux.forms.scrollableform

`<Widget src="ti.ux.forms.scrollableform" id="form"></Widget>`

Creates a form assistant (each field in one scrollable view). Initialize the widget with a json data structure, 
indicating the fields to create, properties for each field, callback methods (in case it is cancelled or validated).

A validation method is automatically assigned to each field depending on its `type` property. A custom validator method
can be declared for each field.

Declaring a `type` customizes the keyboard, passwordMask and validator method. Supported types are:

`text`
`password` 
`email`
`phone`
`number`
`url`

Default type is `text` 

This is an example of json form data:


```javascript

var formData = {
	fields: [
		{
			id: 'username',
			title:'username',
			inputType:'text',
			mandatory: true,
			tipText:'Please, fill in your name',
			autofocus: true
		},

		{
			id:'website',
			title:'Your website',
			inputType:'url',
			mandatory: false,
			tipText: 'Please, fill in a valid website or leave it blank.',
			autofocus: true
		},
		
		{
			id:'email',
			title:'e-mail',
			inputType:'email',			//e-mail includes its own validate method, so no need to overwrite it
			mandatory: false,
			tipText:'Please, fill in your e-mail account',
			autofocus: true
		},
		{
			id:'password',
			title:'password',
			inputType:'password',
			mandatory: true,
			hintText:'6 characters at least',
			tipText:'Set your password',
			errorText: 'The password must contain at least 6 characters',
			autofocus: true,
			validate:function(value){	//customize our own password validation
				Ti.API.info('custom validation called w value: ' + value);
				return value && (""+value).length >= 6;
			}
		},
		{
			id:'confirm-password',
			title:'Confirm password',
			inputType:'password',
			mandatory: true,
			hintText:'6 characters at least',
			tipText:'Repeat the same password, please.',
			errorText: 'The passwords does not match.',
			autofocus: true,
			validate:function(value){	//customize our own password validation
				return value == $.form.getFieldValue('password');		//you can query any form password already introduced
			}
		},
		{
			id:'phone',
			title:'mobile number',
			inputType:'phone',
			mandatory: false,
			tipText:'Insert your phone number',
			autofocus: true
		}
	],
	onCancel: function(e){						//Cancel callback function
		alert('form cancelled');
	},
	
	onFinish: function(data){					//Callback called after last field is validated
		alert("This is your form result: \n\n" + JSON.stringify(data, '', 4));
		$.win.close();
	},
	
	onFieldValidated: function(data){			//Callback called each time a field is validated
		Ti.API.info('Field validated: ' + JSON.stringify(data));
	}
};

```

To create the form, just call it in you `onOpen`  window event:

```javascript
function initForm(){
	$.form.init(formData);
}
```

##### About validators

Validators may include or not a callback function. A callback function can be useful when the validation requires 
a remote connection (for example, to check if a username already exists). If a callback function is used, an 
activityIndicator is shown during the validation.

Have a look to lib/validators.js to see a few examples of validators.


### ti.ux.forms.text

### ti.ux.pagingcontrol

A paging control that can be embebbed to any scrollable view and stylized in style files.

The widget can be declared in Alloy in the xml view file, but must be initialized in code, after the scrollable view is drawn.

```xml
<ScrollableView id="scrollableView" onPostlayout="linkScrollableView" onScrollEnd="updatePagingControl">
	<Label text="View 1" />
	<Label text="View 2" />
	<Label text="View 3" />
</ScrollableView>
<Widget src="ti.ux.pagingcontrol" id="pagingControl" backgroundColor="#fff" top="0"/>

```

In the controller

```javascript
/* SCROLLABLE VIEW FUNCTIONS */

function linkScrollableView(){
	$.scrollableView.removeEventListener('postlayout', linkScrollableView);
	$.pagingControl.linkScrollableView($.scrollableView);
}

function updatePagingControl(e){
	$.pagingControl.setActiveDot(e.currentPage);
}
```

This is an example of pagingControl styling:

```
".view-pagingcontrol":{
	height:"10",
//	backgroundColor:"#fff",
	zIndex: "999",
	width: Ti.UI.SIZE
},
".view-pagingcontrol-dot":{
	height:4,

    <Module id="mapview" module="ti.map" method="createView" />
</Widget>
```
